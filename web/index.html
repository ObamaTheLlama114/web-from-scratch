        <h1>Web from scratch</h1>
        <h2>Summary and Rules</h2>
        <p>This is a project to challenge myself to use the bare minimum it takes to create a website. The only things I am aloud to use are the following</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>glibc</li>
            <li>Asm (which I will not be using but I put it as an option because why not)</li>
            <li>HTML, CSS, and Javascript (only for the frontend)</li>
            <li>Linux, or some other unix based system. As long as I can use glibc for it.</li>
            <li>Any development tools I would like (things like text editors, compilers, etc.)</li>
            <li>NO AI HELP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means no libraries other than glibc, no web frameworks, and no premade database.</p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to build a chatroom with basic authentication, and different chatrooms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a basic frontend with a login screen and a chatroom selector</li>
            <li>Build an api that can serve the frontend and also has api endpoints</li>
            <li>Build a basic database that can store dynamic data through a JSON web api</li>
            <li>Build an api framework for the api and database to use</li>
            <li>Keep the memory errors to a minimum</li>
            <li>Make the whole app secure (or at least securish)</li>
        </ul>
