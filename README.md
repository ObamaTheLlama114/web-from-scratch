# Web from scratch

## Summary and Rules

This is a project to challenge myself to use the bare minimum it takes to create a website. The only things I am aloud to use are the following

- C
- glibc
- Asm (which I will not be using but I put it as an option because why not)
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript (only for the frontend)
- Linux, or some other unix based system. As long as I can use glibc for it.
- Any development tools I would like (things like text editors, compilers, etc.)
- NO AI HELP

This means no libraries other than glibc, no web frameworks, and no premade database.</p>

## Goals

I want to build a chatroom with basic authentication, different chatrooms, and an invite system.

- Build a basic frontend with a login screen and a chatroom selector
- Build an api that can serve the frontend and also has api endpoints
- Build a basic database that can store dynamic data through a JSON web api
- Build an api framework for the api and database to use
- Keep the memory errors to a minimum
- Make the whole app secure (or at least securish)
